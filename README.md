# Project BUGS: AI-Powered Biodiversity Discovery from eDNA

A project for the **Smart India Hackathon 2025**.

* **Problem Statement ID:** 25042 
* **Problem Statement Title:** Identifying Taxonomy and Assessing Biodiversity from eDNA Datasets 
* **Theme:** Software

## The Problem

Traditional methods for analyzing environmental DNA (eDNA) face significant hurdles that limit the scope and speed of biodiversity discovery. Key challenges include:
* **Incomplete Databases:** A vast amount of deep-sea eDNA reads remain unmatched because reference databases are incomplete. 
* **Data Loss:** Unknown or low-confidence reads are often discarded or vaguely labeled, resulting in a loss of potentially novel discoveries. 
* **Computational Bottlenecks:** Alignment-based tools like BLAST are too slow and computationally expensive for the massive datasets generated by modern expeditions.
* **Limited Ecological Insight:** Analysis often stops at taxonomic lists, failing to reveal deeper ecosystem structures, gradients, or patterns. 
* **Slow Validation:** Confirming computationally predicted novel organisms requires a slow and costly biological verification process, creating a significant bottleneck. 

## Our Solution

Project BUGS introduces a **Hybrid AI Pipeline** that revolutionizes eDNA analysis by combining supervised classification with unsupervised discovery. [cite: 31, 32] Our system accurately identifies known species while simultaneously discovering and clustering potential novel taxa from unknown sequences.

Instead of discarding unidentifiable reads, our "Discovery-First" design treats them as opportunities for discovery, enabling a more complete and insightful picture of biodiversity.

### Key Features & Innovation

* **Genomic Transformer (DNABERT-2):** We use DNABERT-2 to create rich numerical representations (embeddings) of DNA sequences, allowing for pattern recognition that is independent of reference databases. 
* **Hybrid AI Pipeline:** The system combines a supervised stream for rapid classification of known taxa with an unsupervised stream for the discovery of novel organisms.
* **Unsupervised Novelty Engine:** Low-confidence and unknown reads are clustered using a powerful combination of **UMAP** for dimensionality reduction and **HDBSCAN** for density-based clustering to identify potential new species. 
* **Ecology-Aware Outputs:** The platform moves beyond simple taxonomic lists to provide valuable ecological insights, including biodiversity ordinations, gradients, and novelty alerts. 
* **Scalable & Deployable:** The architecture supports lightweight analysis for onboard ship results and deeper, full-scale discovery in the cloud.

## Technical Architecture

Our model is built on a three-phase architecture:



* **Phase 1: Feature Extraction:** A raw DNA sequence is tokenized and fed into the DNABERT-2 model. [cite: 61, 64, 67] [cite_start]This phase outputs a high-dimensional "Feature Matrix X1," which is a rich numerical representation of the sequence. 
* **Phase 2: Supervised Classification:** The feature matrix is passed to a neural network classifier. [cite_start]This stream provides a prediction, taxonomic label, and confidence level for known sequences using a SoftMax output.
* **Phase 3: Unsupervised Discovery:** The same feature matrix is also sent to an unsupervised stream. [cite_start]**UMAP** reduces its dimensionality, and **HDBSCAN** performs clustering to group similar unknown sequences into potential novel taxa.
